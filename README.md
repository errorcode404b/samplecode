#Description

- LoadCheck.ps1 was used to check host post automated build to ensure all required services were installed. The LoadCheck.ps1 runs using If/Else blocks by checking to see if a given service is installed and if not reports that service as not installed. If the service is intall, reports the status of the service. 

- The LoadCheck.Tests.ps1 provides three basic Pester test plans. 
    - First test, test the path C:\temp where the files should be located. 
    - Second test, checks to see if the PowerShell code is valid. 
    - Third test, a failure test. Checks LoadCheck.ps1 for my name.

- LoadCheck.RunHelper.ps1, loads the Pester module if not loaded, runs the Pester test then provides the out by opening the log in xml format. This was also to highlight different ways to craft PowerShell script blocks using Begin/Process/End.
